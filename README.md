# laminar

This is Laminar, a Cal Hacks 3.0 Project by Rosa Choe, Legeng Liu, Dillon Yao, and Alan Zhang.

Laminar is a project that works on connecting people by connecting words, sentences, and snippets users around the world send in.
The name is inspired by flow of water bottle refilling water stations. Water is important for life, and the laminar flows are calming.
